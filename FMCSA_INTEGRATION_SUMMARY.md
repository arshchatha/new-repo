## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
```dart
// Example usage of SaferWeb API
final service = SaferWebApiService();
final snapshot = await service.fetchSnapshot('123456');
if (snapshot != null) {
  print('Company: ${snapshot.legalName}');
  print('Status: ${snapshot.status}');
}
```

### Verification Service
```dart
// Example verification during registration
final verificationService = FmcsaVerificationService();
final result = await verificationService.verifyAndUpdateUser(user);
if (result.success) {
  // Update user with verified information
  final updatedUser = verificationService.updateUserWithFmcsaData(user, result.snapshot!);
}
```

### Screenshot Reminder System
```dart
// Check if screenshot is due
final service = FmcsaVerificationService();
final nextDue = service.calculateNextScreenshotDate();
final isDue = service.isScreenshotDue(nextDue);
```

## Configuration

### Routes
Updated `lib/core/config/app_routes.dart` with new routes:
- `/enhancedRegister` - Enhanced registration with FMCSA verification
- `/fmcsaProfile` - FMCSA profile management screen
